According to a study, the approximate level of intelligence of a person can be calculated using the following formula: i = 2 + ( y + 0.5 x )
A program, which will produce a table of values of i, y and x, where y varies from 1 to 6, and, for each value of y, x varies from 5.5 to 12.5 in steps of 0.5.
